Note: This was an academic project and as such, code cannot be shared publicly.

## Introduction
In a world prioritising sustainability and carbon footprint reduction, it is essential to understand how individuals perceive and engage with climate change. The aim of the project was to explore the attitudes and sentiments surrounding this pressing issue.

## Objectives
- Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classify tweets into distinct categories, each representing a perspective into climate change.
    - Sentiment classes:
        - 1 = Pro
        - 0 = Neutral
        - 2 = News
        - -1 = Anti

## Tools
- Python.
- nltk.
- scikit-learn.
- GitHub.
- Comet.

## Results

Our team's top performing model scored an accuracy score of 0.76.
